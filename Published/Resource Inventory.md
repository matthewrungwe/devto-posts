# Resource Inventory

Have you ever found yourself thinking about a resource you used last time but can't remember its name or someone has asked you for resources and you can feel they are somewhere near but you can't seem to get to it? 

In this article I will share a little about a tool called a **Resource Inventory** that can help you package all the resources that you use as a developer.

**What is a resource?**

This is a term that floats around quite a lot but what is it really? It is simply a service that is of value to an individual or an organisation, an asset. If lost, there will be great loss to the organisation as a whole.

**What is an inventory**

A inventory is just a listing, a compilation of services that are available for one or more target groups.

## Advantages of keeping a Resource Inventory
- Improves your productivity by having easy access to tools for your work.
- Saves you time on searches. There is no need to spend tons of minutes searching when you have a resource to answer those kind of questions.
- Speeds up development.
- Easy to share with colleagues and friends.
- Reduced risk of losing information that is important.
- Makes you a better developer as you will have specific resources for each problem.
- Keeps you organised as you will have everything where you need it.
- It is flexible, adjustable and grows as you grow.
- Mobile and portable since you can access your resources from anywhere provided you also deployed them on the cloud.

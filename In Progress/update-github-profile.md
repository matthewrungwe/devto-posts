A shown in the image above, create a new [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo) in your [GitHub](https://github.com) account with the same name as your username. 

**Other things to check:**

To add more information to your profile you can Edit README. The README file is pre-populated with some content to help you get started, curtesy of [GitHub](https://github.com).

**What can you add to your profile?**
- Introduction
- Fun Facts
- Banner
- GitHub Stats
- Contact Details

<h2 id="maintenance">Maintaining your profile</h2>

You can maintain your [GitHub](https://github.com) profile just like you would any other projects. You can `clone` the code for the repository, you can `pull` the code and you can `push` it.

I wish you all the best with creating an attractive and inspiring [GitHub](https://github.com) profile because how you put yourself out there does matter. 

You can let me know what you think below or even share your profiles to inspire others.

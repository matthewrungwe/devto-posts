# How to be a Good Developer?

When I first started out, this was not this question never came up in my mind. Like most, we start asking ourselves this question when we are now preparing for a job. 

So what makes a good developer? On a general note, be good at what you do. While this response is correct, it is vague as to what to focus on and is often interpreted as hard skills. In this article, we are going to look at ways that make you stand out as a developer from when you starting out and throughout your career.

<h2 id="path">Master your Path</h2>

First things first. You need to choose a path. For some it can be Front End Web Development, others Android Development or Cloud Engineering. After you've chosen a path, master it. You don't have to be perfect in the path that you chose but you do need to be competent in it and you need to understand a majority of the features in the path. 

<h2 id="solving">Become a problem solver</h2>
To those who are just starting out and those who have been in the industry for a while now, I think we can all agree that there is a great amount of problems that we get in writing the code. While we have people and databases to turn to:

- [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) 
- [Google](https://www.google.com)
- [Grepper](https://www.grepper.com)

It amazing when you can solve your own problems. Being a problem solver also means you need to be able to come up with ways to implement a feature and if *solution one* is not working, be able to come up with *solution two*. Be able to work around abstacles.

<h2 id="innovative">Be Innovative</h2>
Being innovative means being able to create a solution for a larger audience or to be deployed on a broader scale. 
Our world is filled with challenges and struggles. Being a developer does not just mean you can write code but it also means you are in a place to design solutions, come up with ideas to a lot of problems being faced out there.

<h2 id="learn-to-learn">Learn to learn</h2>

Learning never really ends. There is always going to be something that you did not know, it can be a new technology or a more concise way to implement a feature. Be willing to learn yourself for growth and to improve the way you do things. Be willing to learn from others because everyone has something unique to share. Keep an open mind, never close your doors to growth because you never know what opportunity is around the corner. You can take a look at this article [Your Learning Plan](https://dev.to/matthewrungwe/your-learning-plan-4dp8) I wrote on setting up a learning plan.

<h2>Know how to communicate</h2>

Communication is *extremely important*. Most of your time as a developer is spent communicating, either with a team or with a client. Ask questions where you dont understand, it's beter to be redudent but certain. Share ideas, raise concerns

All in all, to be a good, competent and sort after developer you need to have both Core Skills and Transfereble skills

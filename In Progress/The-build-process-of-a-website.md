So, you have a web project you want to start working on and have no idea how or where to start?
 
In this article, we will look at the *general building process of a website or web application*. This article can serve as a guide to how you can start and finish a website.

<h3 id="overview">The Application overview</h3>

The application overview is essentially a broad but yet simple high-level explanation of the application's reach and. The best way to imagine this is to think of a pitch where you outline the **problem** and the potential **solution** to it.

<h3 id="design">Design the application</h3>

Once you have a general working idea of the application, start working on the design. You can use tools like [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create an interactive design of the web application you have in mind and how it will address your problem. 

**Advantages of having a design:**
- Having an idea of the UI outcome saves time than to figure it out as you go.
- Saves money and resources by having to get feedback from yourself and others before development begins.
- Allows you to be creative and to come up with ideas that can help you stand out. 
- Helps you decide on additional tools you might need to tackle certain features.

Give yourself a little bit of time to design your project. The development stage becomes a lot easier when you have a **blueprint** (mock-up) to refer to when working.

<h3 id="technologies">Decide on the technologies</h3>

Yes! With a detailed application overview and design, you should be able to deduce the complexity and the needs of your application.

In Web Development. An application like a Todo List can easily be created by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript while an app like Netflix may require a framework like Angular, React or Vue to mention a few.

Some applications need to be in constant communication with the servers. Whereas, some may get by handling the user data on the client-side. Understanding the needs of your application will help you to decide beforehand. You can decide on what technologies to incorporate, which database or deployment platform.

<h3 id="setup">Setup the project</h3>

Next, you can start preparing to develop the application. Before we do that, we need to create an environment for the project:

- Creating a repository.
- Creating a project in your repository to track your development.
- Creating issues for the project, link them to your repository, assign them and link them to a milestone.
- Creating milestones, your timelines, like design, development and testing.
- Downloading packages and all dependencies.

<h3 id="development">Develop</h3>

Aah, finally ðŸ˜Š now you can start with your code. Recreate your design using your coding languages and your favourite tools. 

During this time, you will get to: 
- Spend a lot of time trying different ways to implement a feature.
- Follow best practices and conventions.
- Become a close friend of [Google](https://www.google.com/), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) or [Grepper](https://www.codegrepper.com/).
- Create numerous branches and make several commits.
- Create Pull Requests and close issues.

<h3 id="test-n-debug">Test and Debug</h3>

This section is dismissed by so many. **Test, test and test your code.** Debug your code using [Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) in the browsers or any other tools. Make sure your application is not giving back errors, handling requests and data correctly.

<h3 id="review">Review the App</h3>

Take your application for a complete **test drive**. Pretend you are the user for a while, question everything and see how the application does. 

Also, having an extra pair of eyes won't hurt. **Get a different opinion** from a mentor or a trusted friend.

If the review is critical and honest enough, you should be ready to present your idea to the world. 

<h3 id="deployment">Deployment</h3>

Finally, lets **show the world** what we have been working on for the past few hours, weeks or months. **Get a link** that you can share and people can start benefiting from all the work you put in. There are so many deployment platforms out there, among them are [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

<h3 id="overview">The Application overview</h3>

The application overview is essentially a broad but yet simple high level explanation of the application's reach and. The best way to imagine this is to think of a pitch where you outline the **problem** and the potential **solution** to it.

<h3 id="design">Design the application</h3>

Once you have a general working idea of the application, start working on the design. You can use tools like Sketch or Figma to create a interactive design of the web application you have in mind and how it will address your problem. 

**Advantages of having a design:**
- Saves you time by having idea of the UI outcome than having to figure it out as you go.
- Saves money and resources by having to get feedback from yourself and others before development begins.
- Allows you to be creative and to come up with ideas that can help you stand out. 
- Helps you descide on additional tools you might need to tackle certain features.

Give yourself a little bit of time to design your project. Development becoems a lot easier if you have a **blueprint** to work from.

<h3 id="technologies">Decide on the technologies</h3>

Yes! With your detailed overview and your design, you shold be able to deduce the complexity and the needs of your application.

In Web Development, an app like a Todo List can easily be created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript while an app like Netflix may require a framework like Angular, React or Vue just to mention a few.

Some applications need to be in constant communication with the servers where as some may get by handling the user data on the client side. Knowing the needs of your application will help you to decide before hand what technologies to incorporate, the Database or the deployment platform.

<h3 id="setup">Setup the project</h3>

Next, you can start preparing to develop the application. Before we do that, we need to create the environment for the project which may include:

- Creating a repository
- Creating a project in your repository to track your development.
- Creating issues for the project, link them to a repository, assign them and link them to a milestone.
- Creating milestones, your timelines, like design, development and testing.
- Downloading packages and all dependencies.

<h3 id="development">Development</h3>

Aah, finally ðŸ˜Š now you can start with your code. Recreate your design using your coding languages and your favourite tools. 

During this time, you will get to: 
- Spend a lot of time trying different ways to implement a feature.
- Become a close friend of Google, StackOverflow, Youtube and Grepper.
- Create numerous branches and make several commits.
- Create Pull Requests and close issues

<h3 id="test-n-debug">Test and Degub</h3>

This section is dismissed by so many. Test and test and test your code. Debug your code using debugging tools like the Developer Tools in the browsers or any other tools.

<h3 id="review">Review</h3>

A extra pair of eyes won't hurt so you can get a different opinion.

<h3 id="deployment">Deployment</h3>

Finally, lets show the world what we have been working on for the past few hours, weeks or months. Get a link that you can share and people can start benefiting from all the work you put in.

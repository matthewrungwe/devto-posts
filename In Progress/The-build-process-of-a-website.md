<h3 id="overview">The Application overview</h3>

The application overview is essetially a a broad but yet simple simple explanation of the application's reach. The best way to imagine this is to think of a pitch where you outline the **problem** and the potential **solution** to it.

<h3 id="design">Design the application</h3>

Once you have a general working idea of the application, start working on the design. You can use tools like Sketch or Figma to create a interactive design of the web application you have in mind and how it will address your problem. 

A design helps yo to also start getting feedback about the idea you have before you start building it as you can share links of your prototypes.

<h3 id="technologies">Decide on the technologies</h3>

With your design, it becomes easier to decide on which technologies to use. The design allows you to see what languages you can use, the best framework, database or tools.
